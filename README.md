## AXIOS

This is a Collection of Scripts for Axios API requests and call with all of the important method types.

I have combined all the types of API calls and explained them in the comments how each of them can be used. Multiple ways are discussed too in the scripts.

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE
- ALL , SPREAD
- REQUEST
- CONFIG
- INTERCEPTOR
- INSTANCE
